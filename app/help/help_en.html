<h2>How does it work ?</h2>
<p>
	By opening FilmsKollection, you are managing default collection: <b>Collection</b>.<br />
	You can start to add films (<b>Collection -&gt; Scan a dir</b>).<br />
	As soon as your films are added, you can launch the internet update (<b>Collection -&gt; Update films</b>).<br />
	When update is finished, check rapidly your collection, to verify if some films are uncomplete (bold in the list), and correct them.<br />
	You can now enjoy your collection !
</p>

<h2>Manage collections</h2>
<p>
	Use <b>File -&gt; Create collection</b> to create a new collection (created in the <b>collections</b> dir, close to program) and
	<b>File -&gt; Open collection</b> to open an other collection (located anywhere in the computer).
</p>

<h2>Add/Remove films</h2>
<p>
	Use <b>Collection -&gt; Add films</b> to add films (put one film per line), or <b>Collection -&gt; Scan a dir</b> to scan a dir recursively
	and find films.<br /><br />

	Use right-clic on a film or a films selection, then clic on <b>Remove</b> to remove them from collection. If you check <b>Also delete files</b> box,
	program will delete files corresponding if they exist).<br /><br />

	Use <b>Collection -&gt; Re-scan dirs</b> to check in all dirs already scanned if new files have been added, or if files corresponding to
	some films don't exist anymore. Then you can <b>Add</b> ou <b>Remove</b> one or other of lists (or both). You have the possibility to remove films of each list before clicking on buttons
	by selecting film(s) you want, then pushing <b>Suppr.</b> or <b>Delete</b> on keyborad.
</p>

<h2>Fill films informations</h2>
<p>
	Use <b>Collection -&gt; Update films</b> to fill films automatically via internet. If you want to modify a particular film, a right-clic on the film allows several
	options : <br />

	<ul>
		<li><b>All choices</b> to see several choices of film for a same title, you just have to choose the right one, you can even switch title and re-do the search,</li>
		<li><b>Update</b> to fill a sheet by getting informations on the internet using title,</li>
		<li><b>Modify</b> to modify manually the film and to fill all fields yourself;</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Use search engine</h2>
<p>
	Choose which kind of field you want to search on (<b>Search</b> for all fields).<br />
	Start to write your search, some choices will be proposed to you.<br />
	You can see possible choices list by clicking on arrow down.<br />
	Search is done in real time, you can see list of films reducing as you are writing.<br />

	<ul>
		<li>Push <b>Return</b> while you are writing a search permit to show the next film in the list,</li>
		<li>You don't need to write accents (<i>Destinee</i> is the same as <i>Destinée</i>),</li>
		<li>Duration, year and note can be preceded by 5 different signs:
			<ul>
				<li>~ for approximation (<b>duration</b> +/- 10%, <b>note</b> +/- 1, <b>year</b> +/- 2 years)</li>
				<li>&lt;, &lt;=, &gt; et &gt;= for inferior or superior</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Show a selection of films only</h2>
<p>
	Foreach film or selection you want to keep, do <b>Right-clic -&gt; Check</b>, then click on <b>Show films: Checked</b> in top right of window.
	Only films that your are interested in will be shown.
</p>

<h2>Fusion/Unfusion</h2>
<p>
	By selecting several films, it is possible to fusion them (films cut in some parts, for example). Fusion will make disappear of list all films except the first one of selection.
	The sheet of the first film will propose a menu on buttons <b>Launch film</b> and <b>Launch trailer</b> to choose which film
	among those fusioned we want to launch.<br /><br />

	Unfusion a film will make reappear in the list all fusioned films with this film.
</p>

<h2>Switch dir path</h2>
<p>
	If you decide to rename a dir containing some films, films of your collection won't find their assoced file anymore. To remedy to this, do a search by dir by
	seleting that one you just renamed, then select all films present in the list (<b>Ctrl</b> + <b>A</b>) and do <b>Right-clic</b>, then <b>Switch dir path</b> to reassign them
	a new dir path. You can find the old dir path in the arrow down, and you just have to change the name as wanted.
</p>

<h2>Rename files</h2>
<p>
	If you wich to rename all your files correctly, you can launch <b>Collection -&gt; Rename files</b> and choose which field to use (title or original title).<br />
	Sometimes original title is empty, so program propose to replace it with title in these cases.<br />
	On Windows systems, some charaters are forbidden in filenames, program will so replace them with valid characters or remove them (depending on characters). If you
	are on another system, you can uncheck the box, but we advice you to don't do this (so if you want to access your files on another Windows-based system,
	you won't have any problem).
</p>

<h2>Preferences</h2>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Collection by default</b> define which collection will be opened at start of program. List of all possible collections is created from files of the
		<b>collections</b> dir, close to program,</li>
		<li><b>Number of actors to display</b> define how many actors the program must show in film informations,</li>
		<li><b>Minimum file size for scan (Mo)</b> define the minimum size that a file must have to being taken as a film during scan of a dir,</li>
		<li><b>Show full path of files</b> define if program must show the complete url of a film, including dirs containing it, or simply show the filename with
		its extension,</li>
		<li><b>Launch directly random film</b> define if program must launch directly films chosen with button <b>Random film</b> of search bar or simply
		show informations of a film and wait for user to click himself on <b>Launch film</b> button,</li>
		<li><b>Extensions to take when scanning dirs</b> define list of extensions (one per line) that must be considered as films when scanning dirs
		(can only be composed of letters lowercase/uppercase, numbers and - and _);</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Browse collection</h2>
<p>
	FilmsKollection use a database format called SQLite (version 3), and all collection data are stored in a file <b>Name-of-collection.db3</b>.
	To read this file yourself, you must use an external program. We propose you an open and free program: SQLite database browser.<br />

	<ul>
		<li>Official web site: <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net">http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net</a></li>
		<li>Download: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/</a></li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Tricks</h2>
<p>
	Doing a double-click on a film in the list launchs the film.
</p>

<h2>Update program</h2>
<p>
	If automatic download doesn't work, retry by launching FilmsKollection with administrator rigths.<br />
	If you still can't update, you have to download yourself the last version on the web site (<a href="http://www.filmskollection.org">http://www.filmskollection.org</a>).
	Once uncompressed, copy-paste your <b>collections</b> dir and your <b>Config.cfg</b> file in your new dir to get your collection and configuration back.
